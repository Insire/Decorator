		ROADMAP		
	  ===========

	Features that I
	aim to include.

- Proper s/des. of enums

- Make messages to contain other messages as properties without boxing a Message to an object

- [RestOf] attribute
	Takes the ending piece of a message, boxes it into an object[], and passes it into that value

- Deserialization events should have an [DeserializeItem] attribute to specify the item it's trying to deserialize
	instead of hardcoding the first parameter

- IEnumerable<> support as message properties

- Analyzers so the user knows if they're using the attributes correctly

- Use the { get; } and { set; } methods of properties when getting/setting properties, to ensure user code is ran
	Not sure if that's being done already

- [Minify] attribute to convert an int, uint, or higher, to a smaller value that holds the same thing to "minify"
	the packet in more primitive serializers



		CODEBASE	
	  ============	

- Refactoring to make methods smaller

- Implement attribute code in the attribute, not in the serializer/deserializer

- Cleanup ReflectionHelper

- Cleanup Serializer
